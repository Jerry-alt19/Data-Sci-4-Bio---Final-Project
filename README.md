# Optimization of AD domains
Activation domains (ADs) are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that play a key role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with co-activators and components of the transcriptional machinery. 

In this project, we took hydrophobicity, net charge and content of amino acid into account, and used Evo2 to generate more protein sequence embeddings. All of these important features were then used as input for machine learning models to predict AD activity. We applied iterative point mutation generation and screening, aiming to identify optimized AD variants with improved activity.
